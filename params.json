{"name":"Undiscovered Country","tagline":"How To Get Started Exploring Big Data","body":"Resources and tools used for the Codemotion'13 panel \"Undiscovered Country: How To Get Started Exploring Big Data\".\r\n\r\n### About the Panel.\r\nBig Data is a Big Topic, but if you don’t have a PhD or if you’ve never worked at a supercomputer, how do you get started? During this session four ladies will each present a rapid 10-minute intro with a practical approach for big data beginners. We’ll discuss data visualization, APIs, Hadoop, and open datasets. And we’ll use demos and live coding to dispell some of the mystery of data-crunching vodoo. Don’t think you’re ready? Moderators Johanna Brewer and Amélie Anglade will wrap-up by asking the speakers to share their first-time experiences in this undiscovered country.\r\n\r\n[Codemotion Talk Page](http://berlin.codemotionworld.com/talk-page/?talk_name=undiscovered-country-how-to-get-started-exploring-big-data)\r\n\r\nDate: May 10, 2013  \r\nTime: 17:00 - 17:40\r\n\r\nLocation:  \r\n[Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft](http://www.htw-berlin.de/)  \r\nWilhelminenhofstraße 75A  \r\n12459 Berlin  \r\n\r\n### About the Panelists.\r\nIrina Ioana Brudaru, Kate McCurdy, and Monika Moser (@momo13).\r\nBios.\r\n\r\n### About the Moderators.\r\nAmélie Anglade (@utstikkar), Johanna Brewer (@deadroxy).\r\nBois.\r\n\r\n### About this Repo.\r\nInformation about demos and what it contains.\r\nHow to download.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ example commands\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Demo Walkthroughs.\r\nStep-by-step installing, sourcing dataset & running demo.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ example commands\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nGeekettes contact info.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
